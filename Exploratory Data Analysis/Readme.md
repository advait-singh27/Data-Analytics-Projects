# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Projects

## Introduction
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical step in the data analysis process that focuses on understanding the structure, patterns, trends, and anomalies within a dataset before applying advanced analytics or modeling techniques. EDA helps transform raw data into meaningful insights by combining statistical analysis, data visualization, and domain understanding.

The primary goal of EDA is to:
- Understand the underlying data
- Identify relationships and trends
- Detect outliers and inconsistencies
- Prepare data for further analysis or decision-making

## About This Folder
This folder contains multiple projects where I apply **Exploratory Data Analysis techniques** on real-world datasets across different domains. Each project demonstrates a structured approach to analyzing data, starting from data understanding and cleaning to insight generation and business interpretation.

## What I Use in These Projects
Across the projects in this folder, I apply:

### 🔹 Data Preparation
- Handling missing values
- Correcting data types
- Removing duplicates
- Standardizing and cleaning data

### 🔹 Exploratory Analysis
- Summary statistics
- Distribution analysis
- Categorical and numerical analysis
- Relationship and correlation analysis

### 🔹 Feature Engineering
- Creating derived columns
- Time-based features
- Flags and indicators relevant to business questions

### 🔹 Visualization
- Bar charts, line charts, histograms
- Box plots and trend analysis
- Interactive dashboards where applicable

## Tools & Technologies
Depending on the project, I use:
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Power BI** (Power Query, DAX, interactive visuals)
- **Excel** (Pivot tables, formulas, charts)
- **SQL** (for querying and aggregating data)

## Purpose
These projects are part of my data analytics portfolio and demonstrate my ability to:
- Approach data problems systematically
- Extract actionable insights from raw data
- Communicate findings clearly for business stakeholders

Each project includes its own documentation explaining the dataset, approach, and key insights.
