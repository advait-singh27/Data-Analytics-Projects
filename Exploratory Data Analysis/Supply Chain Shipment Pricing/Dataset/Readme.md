## Dataset Description – Supply Chain Shipment Pricing History

### Overview
This dataset contains historical records of supply chain shipments with detailed information on pricing, logistics, quantities, vendors, and delivery timelines. Each record represents a single shipment, making the dataset suitable for exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand shipment cost drivers, transportation patterns, and delivery performance.

The dataset reflects real-world supply chain operations and is commonly used for logistics, procurement, and cost optimization analysis.
