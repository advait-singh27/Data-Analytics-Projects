# 📦 Supply Chain Shipment Pricing – Exploratory Data Analysis

## 📌 Dataset Overview
This dataset contains historical **supply chain shipment pricing and logistics data**, covering shipment details such as transportation mode, vendors, origin and destination locations, delivery timelines, and associated costs.  

The dataset is well-suited for **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand **cost drivers, delivery efficiency, pricing patterns, and operational bottlenecks** within supply chain and logistics operations.

## 📌 Problem Statement

In modern supply chain operations, organizations handle large volumes of shipment data across multiple countries, vendors, transportation modes, and cost structures. However, raw logistics data often lacks clarity and actionable insights without systematic analysis.

The objective of this project is to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a supply chain shipment dataset to understand shipment distribution, transportation patterns, cost drivers, and vendor behavior. By analyzing variables such as shipment country, shipment mode, freight cost, shipment weight, line item quantity, and vendor activity, this project aims to uncover hidden patterns, identify inefficiencies, and highlight key factors influencing logistics performance.

The insights derived from this analysis can help supply chain stakeholders optimize transportation mode selection, improve cost efficiency, strengthen vendor management, and support data-driven decision-making for operational planning and strategy.

## 🎯 Objective of the Analysis
The primary objectives of this EDA project are to:
- Analyze shipment pricing patterns across different shipment modes  
- Identify key factors influencing shipment cost  
- Examine delivery performance and delays  
- Compare vendor-wise and region-wise shipment pricing  
- Detect outliers in shipment cost and delivery timelines
